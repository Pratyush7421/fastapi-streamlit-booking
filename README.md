# fastapi-streamlit-booking
his project is a FastAPI and Streamlit–based Booking System designed to demonstrate a full-stack Python application with both backend APIs and a simple interactive frontend. FastAPI is used to build high-performance RESTful APIs for handling booking logic, data processing, and validations, while Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the system. The project follows a modular structure, supports API testing, and is suitable for learning real-world backend–frontend integration. Sensitive configurations such as API keys and environment variables are managed securely, and the project is structured to be easily extendable for features like database integration, authentication, and deployment. This repository is ideal for understanding modern Python web development practices and Git-based workflows.
